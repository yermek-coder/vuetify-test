Made use of TypeScript, Vuetify in Vue 2 project.

This one is based on test project I made for job interview.
Goal was to make input-area that gets result of JSON.parse function and then show result in table.
User have to give string containing array of objects {id: some number, value: some number} that is correct JSON string.
There is a full validation so user can't brake table.


# vuetify

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```
